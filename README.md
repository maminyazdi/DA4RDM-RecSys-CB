# Research Data Reusability with Content-Based Recommender System

## Abstract

The use of content-based recommender systems to enable the reusability of research data artifacts has gained significant attention in recent years. This repository contains the implementation of a prototype content-based recommender system developed for a study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of such systems in improving the accessibility and reusability of research data artifacts. For detailed insights, please refer to the associated paper.
